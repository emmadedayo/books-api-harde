## Book API(Laravel)

Laravel was used to develop the application because it is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

##  Project Setup
In order to setup the application locally on you system.
1. clone the repository
2. `git clone https://github.com/emmadedayo/books-api-harde.git`
5. install the dependencies for the application
6. `composer install`
7. create a .env file from the .env.example
8. `cp .env.example .env`
9. Generate an application key
10. `php artisan key:generate`
11. create a database called `booksapi` in your database
12. update the env files with your mysql connection details that you have on your system


    DB_CONNECTION=mysql  
    DB_HOST=YOUR_HOST  
    DB_PORT=MYSQL_PORT  
    DB_DATABASE=books  
    DB_USERNAME=MYSQL_USER_NAME  
    DB_PASSWORD=MYSQL_PASSWORD

13. ensure the iceandfire base api is being setup in the .env files
14. ICE_AND_FIRE_URL='https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/' **** IT HAS BEEN TAKEN CAREOF: JUST FOR EASY TESTING
15. Running migration data into the database
16. `php artisan migrate`
17. serving the project
18. `php artisan serve`

##  Testing the Application
**Application Testing**  is defined as a software  **testing**  type, conducted through scripts with the motive of finding errors in software. It deals with  **tests**  for the entire  **application**. It helps to enhance the quality of your  **applications**  while reducing costs, maximizing ROI, and saving development time.

In order to run the feature test that was written
`php ./vendor/bin/phpunit`
when you want to generate a coverage
`php ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html ./coverage`

This generates html report files in the application in the coverage folder, which can be located in the root directory

### Important
Ensure you setup xdebug on your system. <small> [Xdebug Setup for local machine (xampp)](https://medium.com/d6-digital/installing-xdebug-for-xampp-with-php-in-windows-d2b750861118) </small>

##  Testing the Application (user testing)

1. Note:: ** when creating an author in the application you have to arrange the name of the authors separated with commas

2. when testing the external application you can use any of the strings to search for the name of the book

`"name"  or "name or name" or name`

3. To filter the books you need to search with you desired parameters as shown below

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/books?search=A Game of Thrones`

6. click in the `dashboard.html` open with any browser (100% free from risk)
